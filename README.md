Summary:

I created an Android app that goes through a database of songs from the rhythm game Love Live School Idol Festival (LLSIF). If the user wants to gain Loveca (currency used in the game) from the game, they have to take into consideration what kind of cards they are playing with and how skilled they are depending on the song's difficulty. My app will take into consideration the attribute of the song, the difficulty, and the number of Bond Points one will get if they obtain a Full Combo. My app is essentially a game companion app that helps users optimize their Live Points to obtain more Loveca in less time.
